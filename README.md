HS12WinsLog
===========

HS12WinsLog is a script that lets you download all the data from r/12WinArenaLog, a subreddit that collects a list of decks who achieved 12 wins in Arena mode, in a pretty .json format. You'll have the decklist from each post plus a count of how many times each class has been used.

The script is based on the Python Reddit API Wrapper (You can check it out here), so you'll need to install that before running it. You can check out [my blog post](http://alessiofanelli.com/reading-data-with-praw/) with some more infos about the script and the annotated version of the script (s/o to Genius.com!)
